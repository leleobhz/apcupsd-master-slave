# apcupsd-master-slave
This is a simple Ubuntu base with <code>apcupsd</code> installed. It manages and monitors a USB Connected UPS Device, and has the ability to gracefully shut down the host computer in the event of a prolonged power outage.  This is done with no customization to the host whatsoever, there's no need for cron jobs on the host, or trigger files and scripts.  Everything is done within the container.

### Use Cases:
Use this image if your UPS is connected to your docker host by USB Cable and you don't want to run <code>apcupsd</code> in the physical host OS.

Equally, this container can be run on any other host (SLAVE) to monitor another instance of this container running on a host (MASTER) connected to the UPS for power status messages from the UPS, and take action to gracefully shut down the non-UPS connected host.

The purpose of this image is to containerise the APC UPS monitoring daemon so that it is separated from the OS, yet still has access to the UPS via USB Cable.  

### Configuration:

Very little configuration is currently required for this image to work, though you may be required to tweak the USB device that is passed through to your container by docker.

Portainer is the recommended tool here, and makes maintaining and updating this conatiner substantially easier -- particularly if you have multiple APC UPS units, and multiple other systems you wish to be shutdown when power is lost.

Below is the "full" annotated docker-compose for Portainer-Stacks, for use with either an apcupsd MASTER (i.e. connected to the UPS) or SLAVE (i.e. using input from another apcupsd daemon to determine shutdown). The healthcheck section is optional, but polls the status the UPS connection in the case of a standalone or MASTER connected system, or the status of the connection to the MASTER in the case of a SLAVE system.:

#### Fully annotated docker-compose for STANDALONE, MASTER or SLAVE use (Portainer-Stacks recommended):

      - /data/apcupsd:/etc/apcupsd # /etc/apcupsd can be bound to a directory or a docker volume
    restart: unless-stopped

```
Environment variables can be hardcoded into the above docker-compose, or added in the environment section of Portainer. Switch to "Advanced Mode" in Portainer-Stacks in the "Environment variables" section, and paste in the below, to get all of the possible variables in place. Put in your values in place of ${whatever}, and delete any you don't choose to use:

```console
UPSNAME=${UPSNAME}
UPSCABLE=${UPSCABLE}
UPSTYPE=${UPSTYPE}
DEVICE=${DEVICE}
POLLTIME=${POLLTIME} 
ONBATTERYDELAY=${ONBATTERYDELAY}
BATTERYLEVEL=${BATTERYLEVEL}
MINUTES=${MINUTES}
TIMEOUT=${TIMEOUT}
KILLDELAY=${KILLDELAY}
SELFTEST=${SELFTEST} 
APCUPSD_HOSTS=${APCUPSD_HOSTS}
APCUPSD_NAMES=${APCUPSD_NAMES}
TZ=${TZ}
```
